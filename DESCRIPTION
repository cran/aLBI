Description: Provides tools for estimating length-based indicators from length frequency data to assess fish stock status and manage fisheries sustainably. Implements methods from Cope and Punt (2009) <doi:10.1577/C08-025.1> for data-limited stock assessment and Froese (2004) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-2979.2004.00144.x> for detecting overfishing using simple indicators. Key functions include:
    CalPar(): Calculates various lengths used in fish stock assessment as biological length indicators such as asymptotic length (Linf), maximum length (Lmax), length at sexual maturity (Lm), and optimal length (Lopt).
    FishPar(): Calculates length-based indicators (LBIs) proposed by Froese (2004) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-2979.2004.00144.x> such as the percentage of mature fish (Pmat), percentage of optimal length fish (Popt), percentage of mega spawners (Pmega), and the sum of these as Pobj. This function also estimates confidence intervals for different lengths, visualizes length frequency distributions, and provides data frames containing calculated values.
    FishSS(): Makes decisions based on input from Cope and Punt (2009) <doi:10.1577/C08-025.1> and parameters calculated by FishPar() (e.g., Pobj, Pmat, Popt, LM_ratio) to determine stock status as target spawning biomass (TSB40) and limit spawning biomass (LSB25). These tools support fisheries management decisions by providing robust, data-driven insights.
